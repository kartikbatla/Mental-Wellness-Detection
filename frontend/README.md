📊 Machine Learning Workflow
1️⃣ Emotion Prediction

The journal text is analyzed using an emotion classification model to detect emotions such as:

- joy
- sadness
- anger
- fear
- surprise
- love

2️⃣ Emotional Trend Analysis

The system tracks emotional changes over time to compute:

- emotional stability index
- stress probability
- emotional patterns

3️⃣ Questionnaire Analysis

The questionnaire responses are scored and normalized to produce a mental wellness score.

4️⃣ Combined Wellness Score
Final Wellness Score =
Emotion Score + Questionnaire Score

This score determines the user’s mental wellness status.

📈 Weekly Analysis

The system performs weekly analytics including:

- emotion distribution
- average wellness score
- stress trend
- emotional stability index

This information is displayed on the dashboard using interactive charts.
